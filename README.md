# My Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio represents the best of my work completed during the Birmingham University Bootcamp. It is intended to give an overview of the skills I have gained and the progress I have made so far. As such, it will be updated regularly during the course. As we are currently on Week 10 of a 24 week programme, the content is necessarily limited, and - in all honesty - does not include my worst attempts! But hopefully, by the end of the course, it should give a pretty good idea of my skills as a coder.

## Usage
Clearly, the main use of this portfolio is show of my current capabilities to prospective employers and to give an update to those interested in my progress.

## Technology Employed
So far, this portfolio has been built entirely from HTML and Bootstrap. That could change as i update it.

## Challenges and Learning
I don't mind admitting that the first time I attempted this portfolio, it was a disaster. 
Now, it is much better and I've learned a huge amount, making it that way. I particularly had to learn about mobile-first design, which didn't come intuitively to me and which I still need to improve at. The practice I gained through designing and re-designing within the bootstrap grid system was invaluable. And I learned about overlays, of various types, some of which didn't remain in the finished project. All in all, a great learning experience.

## Future Development
 Obviously, I'd like this portfolio to grow as I achieve more in coding, to reflect my ongoing progress. I'd also like to make it more engaging, to include more referenc to life outiside of Bootcamp, as well, as, increasingly, I think employers are interested in what employees bring to the workplace beyond just job-related skills (crucial as they may be), such as interpersonal skills and personal interests. I'd really like to include more images, especially via a carousel. I'd like to generally create more links to other places and perhaps develop a more personal profile, whether integral to this one or linked to it somehow. Or perhaps that's a distinct project altogether.
I'd also like to integrate my CV to a greater degree, as well. It seems anomalous to include a 'flat' PDF in something like this, especially when the goal of nearly all our work as coders is to make information engaging.
